    <h2>
        WHAT IS THE MISSION? <br/>
            The mission of the Foundation
            is to foster student excellence, 
            teacher creativity and school based 
            initiatives at the Ponaganset Schools. <br/> <br/>

        HOW WILL THIS WORK? <br/>
            Designed to augment the educational programs 
            offered by the School District, the Foundation
            will support the development of new, 
            creative and innovative programs or 
            activities that encourage and inspire 
            students to become more deeply involved 
            in the learning process. The Foundation 
            will encourage teachers and others to 
            offer interesting and challenging ideas 
            in the form of grant proposals. <br/> <br/>

        HOW DID THIS GET STARTED? <br/>
            Thanks to the generous contributions, 
            large and small, of numerous townspeople, 
            friends and alumni of the Ponaganset 
            Schools, those who saw the benefits 
            of an educational foundation were 
            able to raise the necessary $25,000 
            to qualify for matching funds from the 
            Rhode Island Foundation by the December 
            2006 deadline. Thus the Ponaganset 
            Education Foundation was founded. <br/> <br/>

        WHAT ARE THE FOUNDATION GOALS? <br/>
            The Foundation's goal is to promote 
            and develop a significant financial 
            resource from which to make grants 
            that have the potential to inspire 
            students to become fully engaged in 
            what they are learning; be it pottery, 
            poetry, rocket science, hydro-energy, 
            global warming, or history. <br/><br/>

        WHY AN EDUCATION FOUNDATION FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS? <br/>
            With the present demands and expectations placed 
            on the public schools by the State and Federal 
            government, it is increasingly difficult for 
            local schools to do more than meet the basic 
            requirements and mandates. This leaves nominal 
            financial support for schools to initiate new, 
            creative or innovative programs or activities 
            to excite and stimulate student interest. 
            Recognizing the already heavy demand on 
            the local taxpayer and the constraints 
            placed on taxes by the State, the Ponaganset 
            Education Foundation offers an alternative 
            means to funding these worthy endeavors. <br/><br/>

        HOW WILL THE FOUNDATION HELP?<br/>
            The Foundation offers friends, 
            residents, benefactors and alumni 
            the ability to invest whatever their 
            means may allow above and beyond 
            their required tax contribution. 
            These Foundation Grants will help 
            teachers and admnistrators enhance 
            the educational programs at the 
            Ponaganset Schools to meet the 
            present and future challenges 
            facing education and our students. <br/><br/>

        WILL THIS WORK? <br/>
        It is the belief of the Foundation 
        that the communities of Foster and 
        Glocester have long supported and 
        valued the quality education the 
        Ponaganset schools have provided. 
        It is the aim of the Foundation to 
        honor that commitment and to preserve 
        and enhance the excellence in 
        education for which Ponaganset 
        has been recognized. <br/><br/>
